I had a hard time deciding to order from here coz the options are plenty. I ordered for a simple Chicken hot n sour soup. It turned out really amazing, the taste, texture, balance of flavours were just on point also with the ample amount of chicken and veggies it had in it. Im honestly craving for another bowl of it right now. Just a word for the packaging, it probably can be made a little better than what it is.

All their food is good for the price point. This location has a buffet which is priced at 599 and for that price it's extremely worth it. There isn't another buffet in the city that offers prawn fish chicken and lamb in the starters and in the main course for 599. Some of the food is under salted but I think that is because most Arab cuisine is on the blander side. Zaitoon also has an amazing offer during Ramzan where they give a box with meal for just 399.
